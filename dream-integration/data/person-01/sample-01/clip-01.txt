 Today just feels different. Visiting the Mahadev Mondir gave me a kind of peace I didn't realize I needed. Everything just slowed down for a bit. And now sitting here by the lake side with the breeze brushing past and the calm water in front of me, this is honestly the best part of my day. I feel light, happy and connected. Like everything is just right in this moment.
