# DREAMS 
**Documenting Recovery Experiences through Emotion-Aware Multimedia Stories**

---

## Overview
**DREAMS** is an open-source, research-ready platform designed to support **clinicians**, **researchers**, and **mental health professionals** in analyzing how individuals document recovery journeys through photos and captions.

By combining **natural language processing**, **temporal analysis**, and **thematic clustering**, DREAMS enables the study of emotional trajectories and life narratives — particularly within **vulnerable or marginalized communities**.

## Architecture and Flow

At a high level, DREAMS uses a modular architecture:

1.  **Data Ingestion**: Users upload photos and captions via a web or mobile interface of Beehive.
2.  **NLP Pipeline**: Captions are processed for sentiment, keywords, and other features.
3.  **Analysis Engine**: Temporal and thematic analyses are performed.
4.  **Visualization**: Results are displayed through interactive dashboards.

##  Use Cases

- **Track recovery progress** across months via emotional sentiment from image captions
- **Identify thematic triggers** (e.g. certain places or topics linked to mood changes)
- **Study collective healing patterns** in group-based recovery programs
- **Enable personalized, data-driven mental health interventions**
